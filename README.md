# Koc-Museum
This SwiftUI project is an interactive museum navigation app designed to enhance visitor experiences at the Rahmi M. Koç Museum in Istanbul. It combines rich historical content with map-based navigation, helping users explore exhibitions, plan routes, and discover personalized recommendations based on their interests.

Interactive Map with Routing:
Users can navigate through different museum floors (basement, ground, and first) and view annotated exhibits. A greedy path algorithm computes the shortest walking route between selected points.

Exhibit Annotations & Crowdedness Indicators:
Each annotation reflects an exhibit's real-time crowdedness level using colored pins (green, orange, red). High-crowdedness areas prompt user confirmation.

Personalized Preferences:
Visitors can select their interests (e.g., aviation, toys, science) to receive tailored room suggestions.

Detailed Exhibit Descriptions:
Includes multilingual and thematically grouped descriptions of all exhibits (e.g., Atatürk, transportation, science, communication).

Floor Legend & Section Navigation:
Users can browse museum sections like the Mustafa V. Koç Building and Tershane Shipyard via a clear legend interface.

Technologies Used:
SwiftUI
MapKit
CoreLocation
UIKit (for alerts and integration)

This app was developed as part of an iOS development project exploring SwiftUI, interactive maps, and user-centered design principles in cultural heritage applications.
